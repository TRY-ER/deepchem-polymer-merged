# VAE Sampler Configuration
# Optimized sampling parameters for VAE models

# Generation Parameters (VAE-specific)
generation:
  decoding_strategy: "top_k"  # Top-k often works well with VAE
  temperature: 1.0  # Higher for VAE latent diversity
  top_k: 40
  top_p: 0.9
  repetition_penalty: 1.15
  max_length: 90
  
# Batch Generation
batch:
  num_sequences: 25  # Generate more due to VAE diversity
  starter_presets:
    - "random"
    - "carbon_chain"
    - "aromatic"

# Model-specific notes
notes: |
  VAE sampling configuration:
  - Top-k strategy for controlled diversity
  - Higher temperature to leverage latent space
  - More sequences to explore latent diversity
  - Moderate repetition penalty for VAE characteristics
